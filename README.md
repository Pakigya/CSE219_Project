This program helps user to create a website to showcase the TAs added through this program. The program will let the user select how many pages their site should have and then what sections of content should appear on the site. In addition, we'll build a modular system for adding dynamically loaded content for things like the course office hours grid and schedule. The application will generate the necessary HTML and complementary JSON files for loading such dynamic data.
